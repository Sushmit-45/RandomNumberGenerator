Initially, we kicked around the idea of converting music into color—it sounded cool,
but we knew it wasn’t exactly practical. After some brainstorming, we pivoted and
ended up with a project that converted noise into color. This transformation was 
then turned into an alphanumeric random number, which provided true randomness—
something that standard computer-based random functions lack, as they’re just 
pseudo-random.

We got inspired by the concept of lava lamps used by Soundflare, where the 
unpredictability of noise can create unique visual patterns. So, we assigned 
values to different noise attributes and processed those to generate an 
alphanumeric string. It felt like we were tapping into a whole new realm of 
randomness!We thought of Cryptography,Hashing, all uses ranging from network 
security to Monte Carlo simulations in Finace, the uses were ennumbered. Random 
Numbers are often required in secured transfer protocols and many various kinds
of places and this is the exact kind of problem we are addressing here.

We faced challenges with our unique idea, initially struggling to find practical 
applications. Eventually, we realized we could use it for encryption and decryption,
aiming to create a faster RSA substitute using our RNG generator as the key. We also
planned to build a secure messaging and file transfer app with API connections. 
However, we hit a major issue with key transmission without exposing private information. 
Despite our efforts, a senior advised us to drop the project, which was disappointing
given the time invested.

After that, we grappled with finding more uses beyond basic hash function cryptography and 
password generation. Ultimately, we decided to submit the RNG generator as our final project.
The journey may have shifted, but the potential of this encryption algorithm remains exciting!
It’s a testament to creativity and innovation, proving that even if a project doesn’t unfold 
exactly as planned, the exploration itself can lead to some incredible discoveries.
As a fun part to add we used matplotlib to plot something fun.
